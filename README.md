# React Interview Answer

## Requirements
npm or yarn

## Run
```
npm install
npm run start
// or
yarn
yarn start
```

## Build
```
npm run build
// or
yarn build
```

## Notes
- we used react-stack-grid which gives nice animations
- if we don't want animations a simple flex-wrap: wrap works
- tested with latest versions of Google Chrome and Firefox
- pagination is not server-side
- there's no API calls
